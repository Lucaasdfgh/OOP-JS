If an object has one or more methods (functions) it’s called behavior

If in an function object you called the object in the parameters and the key value is the same you can just type the name 

JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects. A JavaScript method is a property containing a function definition. Methods are functions stored as object properties.
